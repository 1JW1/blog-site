Hi, Iâ€™m Jerome Wanliss, a Cybersecurity Analyst with 5 years of experience and a background in software engineering. I began my career building applications before moving into cybersecurity, where I now focus on governance, risk, and compliance, while keeping aware of developments in cloud security.  

I have rolled out AWS WAF across more than 150 APIs, secured 44 domains with Terraform and NCSC registration, and chaired incident governance meetings. If there is a process, I aim to make it secure, and if there is not one, I am likely to write a playbook for it.  

I hold **CompTIA Security+** and **ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC)** certifications, and I am working towards **CISSP** and **ISO/IEC 27001 Lead Implementer**. These reflect my ambition to grow further in governance, risk, and compliance while building on a solid technical foundation.  

Outside of work, I balance the screen time with the gym, exhibitions, and the occasional hike. Think of me as someone who secures systems by day and collects DOMS (delayed onset muscle soreness) by night.
